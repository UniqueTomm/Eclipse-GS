# Eclipse 3.6 GameServer

After a long while since Eclipse shutdown, we have decided to make it open source. Altough we will not help set-up.
<br/>
This is the same build from September 2024 but with a few optimizations to make it run better.
<br/>
<br/>
Some features were not finished and are not planned to be finished, such as:
<br/>
- Proper Game Sessions
- Quests

Known Bugs:
<br/>
[-] Chests have a chance of only dropping mats.
<br/>
[-] Teams have a chance to overflow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Updates might happen ever so often.*
